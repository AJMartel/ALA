{"name":"ALA","tagline":"Arduino Light Animation (ALA) is a library for Arduino boards to simplify the development of light animations using LEDs and LED strips.","body":"\r\n##Features\r\n\r\n- Pure Arduino implementation. No external software is needed on the PC to design and drive light animations.\r\n- Support for monochrome LED, RGB LED, multiple LEDs and addressable RGB LED strips using **PWM output pins**, **WS2812 RGB LED strips** and **TLC5940 chips**.\r\n- Lots of cool animations ready to use.\r\n- Precise timing to allow synching animations to music.\r\n- No use of delay() to allow to drive multiple channels and lines independently.\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\nMore details, examples and projects can be found [here](http://yaab-arduino.blogspot.com/p/ala.html).\r\n\r\n##Contributing\r\n\r\nIf you discover a bug or would like to propose a new feature, please open a new [issue](https://github.com/bportaluri/ALA/issues).\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
